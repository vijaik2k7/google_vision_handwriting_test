# Testing Google Cloud Vision API On Handwritten Documents
Reference examples using Google Cloud's Vision API to understand performance on three different types of handwritten documents:

## Takeaway
Overall, the API does a pretty good job with handwritten text that are well formatted, clean and easy to read to the human eye. Even the ones that are smudgy, too cursive or usually difficult to read are returned with a decent accuracy although with a lower confidence and some errors in the predictions. There could be smarter ways to handle some of these errors (like looking for the closest meaningful English word etc. depending on the use case).

Hello , everyone ! I made a Reddit account solely for the purpose of posting this . I often get compliments on my handwriting in school and I ' m curious to see what this thread thinks .
